# Task-manager
It is a CRUD RESTful API that allows users to create accounts and create tasks, upload images to their profile, view their profile, and complete tasks. The app generates an automatic confirmation email, using SendGrid, once they sign up for the service, get a deletion message whenever they choose to delete their account.
